# Awesome Culture [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
A curated list of resources for nurturing awesome tech, design and product culture. Inspired by the `awesome-*` projects.

There are other awesome-culture lists but I found mine was quite different. Selected resources are the ones I refer to and share again and again. List will evolve. Feel free to contribute! Please follow the [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) model ;)
